# [Foundation for the Rights of Future Generations](https://www.intergenerationaljustice.org/)

The Foundation for the Rights of Future Generations (FRFG) is a think tank and activist group founded in 1997 by a non-partisan alliance of five young people between the ages of 18 and 27. We are one of the youngest foundations in Germany to this day. Ambassadors, trustees and researchers support the foundation in its work.
