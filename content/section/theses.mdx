## Fundamental need for resonance.
Humans and the world need resonance. The interplay of the need to affect and be affected by the world, the intrinsic interest and perceived self-efficacy, as well as the strive for transformation are fundamental affective and motivational characteristics of resonance. – “A better world is possible, and it can be recognized by its central criterion, which is no longer domination and control, but listening and responding.” (Rosa)

## Resonance emerges from manifest indicators interplay of the body in its physical and social environment.
Humans have 4E cognition (embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended). Research, education, and therapy need to acknowledge the fundamentally contextualized nature of human existence. We need to gather data that results from the interactions of human beings with one another, their environment, and the methods and tools they use to support these processes.

## Striving for the acknowledgment of intersubjective reality is a key to social understanding and connection.
Objective reality is subjectively perceived but subjective reality is hard to access from an external position. A great chance for social cohesion is the acknowledgment of intersubjective reality, of a shared reality. If everyone maintains that their own reality is the only viable reality, social understanding and resonant relationships are less likely. To foster this perspective, we need to move beyond research, education, and therapy that focuses only on the individual and strive for more socially contextualized approaches.

## Resonance and Bewusstseinskultur (culture of consciousness) are connected.
Culture is a shared meaning system (Erez & Gati, 2004). Resonance helps to achieve shared meaning, and, hence, resonance helps the Bewusstseinskultur. Ethical states of consciousness are resonance phenomena. Consequently, Bewusstseinskultur needs the term resonance. 

## Resonance and the plurality movement are connected. 
Plurality can be seen a form of systemic resonance. The philosophy and ideas of the plurality movement offer possibilities to scale a Bewusstseinskultur. In turn, this Bewusstseinskultur offers practices to foster a cultivation of benevolence (principle of charity).

## Resonance can be lived.
Whereas resonance is non-engineerable, there are contexts in which resonance  is more likely. We need to operationalize, organize, and scale resonance, define and promote processes that foster it, and introduce these to our work [i.e., applicability of ideas in research, education, therapy, and policy-making(plurality movement)].
