**11:00–13:30 | With Dr. Till Kastendieck & Bastin Jafari**

Explore how resonance can serve as a model for connection, setting, and transformation – in science, therapy, and society. This interactive workshop includes four hands-on modules drawing from philosophy, psychology, systems theory, and practical application:

1. What resonance is from a philosophical and psychological perspective, and how it relates to other fundamental concepts such as emotion and empathy  
2. Whether resonance can be measured with scientific methods  
3. How it can be scaled with technology in collaborative, democratic, and pluralistic systems  
4. How it can be lived in and applied to daily life
