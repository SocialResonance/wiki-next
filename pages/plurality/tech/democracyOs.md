This program developed a free, open-source software that allows citizens to vote on, track, and debate current legislation in order to encourage a robust public debate and empower citizens to build a more inclusive, collaborative, and open social system. DemocracyOS also entailed a series of media appearances, demos, and meetings with the Argentine legislature to promote the launch of the software.
