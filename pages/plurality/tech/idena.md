<h2>PROOF OF PERSON BLOCKCHAIN</h2>
<h3>COORDINATION OF INDIVIDUALS</h3>

Idena is new cryptocurrency technology and, among many other things, it is a payment processing network that works over the internet. In order for the Idena network to work, it requires people who are part of that network and who are helping to maintain it. Right now, there are 1442 people in Idena network.

<h3>ENCOURAGING INDIVIDUALS</h3>

To increase network diversity Idena provides higher returns for smaller stakes. Individual APY is always higher than the APY of staking pools or richer accounts.

<h3>WHY PROOF OF PERSONHOOD</h3>

Unlike PoS and PoW blockchains, to become a validator Idena requires you to prove that you are a unique person. Why?

Proof of Personhood allows you to maximize rewards as an individual miner and prevents the concentration of capital in staking pools.

<h2>Proof of Personhood is the building block for Web 3.0</h2>
<h3>Use cases</h3>

DAO, governance, quadratic funding, UBI, airdrops, oracles, individual loans, courts, decentralized ads, censorship free publications, reputation system, prediction markets, decentralized insurance, decentralized escrow and many more.

<h3>Internet for people, not bots</h3>

Authorize users with Idena. Don`t ask users who they are. Ask them if they have multiple of accounts or not.

<h3>Smart contracts and identity</h3>

Issue IRC20 tokens and lock them as identity stake. Use token staking for airdrops and plutocracy-resistant DAOs governed by token-backed identities.
