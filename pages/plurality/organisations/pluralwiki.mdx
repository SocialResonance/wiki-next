# Plural Wiki

Plural Wiki is both an experiment and a collaborative knowledge platform on meta-crisis, plurality, etc., as well as an open source framework for communities to build a decentralised coordinated dialogue and central information hub. By using plural technologies such as Pol.is and Quadratic Voting, we want to iteratively advance the creation of a transparent, self-managed platform that is completely administered by its own community. We are open to results and see the process as an experiment that we will document ourselves in the wiki in order to be able to derive best practices from it.
