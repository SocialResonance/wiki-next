Participants in the Recursive Public represent a diverse set of global perspectives online. Some of the volunteers, individuals and organisations who take part are shown below.

We rely in the spirit of open collaboration: no statement made as part of a Recursive Public deliberation should be taken as a final position nor representative of any of the organisations participating in the conversation.
