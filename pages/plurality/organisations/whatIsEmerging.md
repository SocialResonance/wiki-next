Emerge is a network responding to the question of what is happening within, between and beyond human beings in a civilisation that appears to be dying. We connect pioneers, seekers, innovators and their initiatives. We highlight what we share and seek to make visible the patterns that connect us. We help each other to respond to the most urgent challenges of our time. Together, we will sow the seeds of a new civilisation.

<strong>Our Project</strong>

Emerge is a response to the meta-crisis, which shows its face in the emergencies of climate, politics, environment and meaning. We believe not only that our challenges are interconnected, but that we must connect in new ways to grapple with the most urgent problems of our times. Linking people, projects, networks and ideas, we investigate what is emerging. We are also a community of practice, exploring new patterns of living, working, being and sense-making. 

The emergence of a more conscious society has already begun. Emerge connects transformative and inspirational innovators and initiatives across the globe. We spotlight the most daring pathfinders and visionaries who are using systems thinking, driving spiritual renewal or personal and cultural transformation, and who lovingly seduce cynical minds into seeing more beautiful alternative worlds.

On our website, we shine a light on those offering their work, wisdom and new ways of thinking. We tell the stories of the fast-growing multitude of renegade seekers and their projects, highlighting the patterns that unite the different tribes of transformation. Joining the dots between agents and actions all over the world, we seek to awaken the wild imagination needed for making the new civilisation a reality. 

<strong>Who We Are</strong>

We are a rapidly growing community of doers, dreamers and thinkers looking to create a new kind of “We.” Connecting individuals and collectives, Emerge celebrates visionaries who explore dynamic solutions to our planet’s greatest challenges. We are activists, artists and academics, entrepreneurs and educators, philosophers and philanthropists, spiritual seekers, soul workers and scientists. Diversity of perspectives and openness to audacious thinking are our core strengths. Showcasing and analysing the most daring insights from across the system-changer ecosphere, we seek to serve all those who share an Emerge sensibility.
