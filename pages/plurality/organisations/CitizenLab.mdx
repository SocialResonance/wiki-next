## Our mission

CitizenLab's mission is to build stronger democracies by making public decision-making more inclusive, participatory, and responsive.

## Our essence

We care about the success of your community engagement efforts as much as you do.

When you choose to work with us, we'll be active partners and provide personal onboarding, dedicated support throughout your engagement initiatives, and peer learning from a growing network of governments and organizations running similar platforms around the world.
