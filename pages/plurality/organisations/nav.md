NAV operates and develops an open infrastructure with networks and meeting places for sustainable societal development, innovation and learning. Together with partners from authorities, business, academia and civil society, cross-border interaction is created around society's common challenges.

NAV offers contexts where artistic expression and experimental formats are integrated with in-depth dialogue. Different perspectives and areas of knowledge are allowed to clash with each other so that something new can open up and emerge.

NAV promotes intergenerational meetings and welcomes people with different professions, backgrounds and experiences.
