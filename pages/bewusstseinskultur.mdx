# Bewusstseinskultur (Culture of Consciousness)

According to philosopher Thomas Metzinger, the concept of a Bewusstseinskultur entails:

1. The adoption of an ethical attitude toward one's mental state;
2. the systematic cultivation of states classified as valuable;
3. a continuous process of rational, evidence-based enculturation, i.e., the active embedding of such states of consciousness in culture and society.
