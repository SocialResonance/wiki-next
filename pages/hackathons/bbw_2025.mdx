This hackathon is about scaling meaningful human connection and sustainable transformation. We invite programmers and non-programmers to join us in prototyping collaborative open-source technologies that facilitate resonance spaces.

## What are Resonance Spaces?

Resonance spaces are contexts in which the relational mode of resonance is more likely. According to socio-philosopher Hartmut Rosa, resonance is a desirable mode of being in the world, a form of relationship with the world that is characterized by being able to reach and be reached and transformed by others, things/objects, totalities such as nature, art, technology, spiritual entities, and the world as such (see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXsoK7y1FQ)).

## Details
- **Date**: June 20-22, 2025
- **Time**: 10 am to 8 pm daily
- **Location**: MIND Foundation, In den Schreibfederhöfen (2nd backyard, Boxhagener Str. 78, 10245 Berlin)
- **Format**: In-person
- **Cost**: Free

## Overview

Organizations that promote the development of an ethical culture of consciousness (for more, see [Bewusstseinskultur](https://mind-foundation.org/blog/bewusstseinskultur) or [The Enculturation Problem](https://academic.oup.com/book/58175/chapter-abstract/480356539?redirectedFrom=fulltext)), face the privilege and challenge of dealing with meaningful experiences that people have, for example, in therapy, nature immersion, or social gatherings.

On the one hand, such experiences are inherently subjective and often difficult to share effectively beyond small social groups. On the other hand, effective sharing at scale is necessary to stimulate change in a larger cultural context. For example, in organizations that strive for a culture of consciousness, patients, researchers, therapists, or educators, face the challenge that available tools are still underdeveloped. One reason for this being communication hurdles with programmers who are supposed to implement such tools.

This could be implementations like an interactive map to locate academic journal clubs, a platform to dynamically and iteratively draft a Code of Conduct and Best Practices for Integration Circles with a world wide Finder and Ranker of these, a tool to help sound therapists and breath workers to visualize sound and intensity for increased therapeutic effect, a "Reddit" for Insights, etc.

Technology can help people and organizations create resonance spaces and discover meaning when they follow plural principles, such as treating human connections paramount, democratizing access to technology, and improving democracy (governance) with technology (see [plurality.net](https://plurality.net)).

## Vibe Coding Approach

Collaborative vibe coding* has the potential to facilitate a creative process as it merges the minds of programmers and non-programmers and translates plain language into code language. Importantly, for us, vibe coding is not only about AI-assisted programming. It is about knowing the "vibe" that tool end-users envision should have and cultivating a shared vibe among people in an immersive atmosphere of open, safe, free, accessible, and inclusive discussion.

*Vibe coding = "Vibe coding is a term for coding with the assistance of AI — essentially, using AI tools to do the heavy lifting of writing code while you focus on guiding the process with ideas and descriptions." ([Source](https://medium.com/@niall.mcnulty/vibe-coding-b79a6d3f0caa))

## Focus Areas

Focus areas of the hackathon include exploring decentralized, plural, collaborative methods and brainstorming ideas for practical applications that can help build an ethical culture of consciousness. The practical coding sessions will be interwoven with breaks of "food for tummy, food for thought" blitz talks with social-psychological science communications in theory and empirical findings to benefit designing social computing tools (on topics such as empathy, self-other merging, shared reality, extended cognition).

## Goal

The goal of the hackathon is to bring together different people interested in a culture of consciousness, for example, uniting Blockchain Week attendees and MIND members. We are looking forward to sharing our enthusiasm for developing tools that foster organizations in science, therapy, and education, built on principles of resonance, plurality, participatory democracy, and collaborative technology.

## About

The MIND foundation is a Berlin-based non-profit science, therapy, and education organization with the mission to bring psychedelic therapy into public health care. The hackathon is facilitated by software engineer Bastin Jafari (background in philosophy and computer science, CTO buddyhelp.org) and social psychologist Dr. Till Kastendieck (HU Berlin), section organizers of the Resonance Section at the MIND Members Association.
