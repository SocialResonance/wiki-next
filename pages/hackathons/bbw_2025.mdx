# BBW 2025 Hackathon

## Democracy, Meaning, & Technology: Vibe Coding for a Scalable Culture of Consciousness

This hackathon is about scaling meaningful human connection and transformation. We invite programmers and non-programmers to join us in prototyping collaborative open-source technologies that facilitate resonance spaces. It is open to the public, free-of-charge, and happens during three days from June 20th to 22nd (10 am to 8 pm) at the MIND Foundation in Berlin-Friedrichshain.

## Overview

Organizations active in a culture of consciousness (for more, see [Bewusstseinskultur](https://www.mind-foundation.org/blog/bewusstseinskultur)), face the privilege and at the same time, the challenge of dealing with meaningful experiences that people make (e.g., in psychedelic therapy and education).

On the one hand, such experiences are inherently subjective and often difficult to share beyond small social groups.

On the other hand, stimulating change in a larger societal culture demands effective sharing at scale. Another challenge is that patients, therapists, or educators who often need new tools that need to be iteratively developed along with their unfolding experience may encounter communication hurdles with programmers who are supposed to implement such tools.

Technology can help people and organizations create resonance spaces and discover meaning when they adhere to plural principles, such as treating human connections as first-class objects/paramount, democratizing access to technology, and improving democracy (governance) with technology (see [plurality.net](https://plurality.net)).

## Vibe Coding Approach

Collaborative vibe coding* has the potential to facilitate a creative process by merging the minds of programmers and non-programmers by translating plain language into code language. Importantly, for us, vibe coding is not only about AI-assisted programming. It is about knowing the vibe a certain tool end-users envision should have and also means cultivating a shared vibe among people in an immersive atmosphere of open, safe, free, accessible, and inclusive discussion.

*Vibe coding = "Vibe coding is a term for coding with the assistance of AI — essentially, using AI tools to do the heavy lifting of writing code while you focus on guiding the process with ideas and descriptions." ([Source](https://medium.com/@niall.mcnulty/vibe-coding-b79a6d3f0caa))

## Focus Areas

Focus areas of the hackathon include exploring decentralized, plural, collaborative methods and brainstorming ideas for practical applications that can help a culture of consciousness. The practical coding sessions will be interwoven with breaks of "food for tummy, food for thought" blitz talks with social-psychological insights into theory and evidence beneficial for designing social computing tools (on topics such as empathy, self-other merging, shared reality, extended cognition).

## Goal

The goal of the hackathon is to stimulate systemic resonance by bringing together different people interested in a culture of consciousness and Blockchain Week attendees, with enthusiasm for psychedelic science, therapy, education, participatory democracy, and collaborative technology.

## Facilitators

The hackathon is facilitated by:
- Software engineer Bastin Jafari (background in philosophy and computer science, CTO buddyhelp.org) and social psychologist Dr. Till Kastendieck (HU Berlin).
 Section organizers of the Resonance Section at the MIND Members Association.
