# Welcome to the Resonance Wiki

## Please note that this website is in the early stages of its construction.

This is a wiki for the Resonance Section of the [MIND Foundation](https://www.mind-foundation.org/) in Berlin. 

Resonance is the fundamental relational mode that enables us to connect with one another and the world we live in.

For a vibrant culture of consciousness, we resonate. We resonate with the world â€” we resonate with one another, the things we interact with, the totalities we cherish, be it nature, art, any god you chose, or the universe. 

We chose the wiki format as we strongly believe in collaboration and participation. You are invited to contribute to the content of the wiki, just as you are invited to contribute to the work of the Resonance Section overall. 

For any questions, please contact the section speakers and wiki hosts [Till Kastendieck](mailto:till.kastendieck@hu-berlin.de) and [Bastin Jafari](mailto:bastin.jafari@gmail.com).
