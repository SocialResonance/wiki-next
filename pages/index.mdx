### Please note that this website is in the early stages of its construction. ðŸš§

This is a wiki for the Resonance Section of the [MIND Foundation](https://www.mind-foundation.org/) in Berlin. 

Resonance is the fundamental relational mode that enables us to connect with one another and the world we live in.

Humans strive to resonate. We resonate with the world â€” with one another, the things we interact with, and the totalities we cherish, be it nature, art, any god you chose, or the universe. 

The website of the Resonance Section has a wiki format to invite participation, contribution, and collaboration. 

For any questions, please contact the section speakers and wiki hosts [Till Kastendieck](mailto:till.kastendieck@hu-berlin.de) or [Bastin Jafari](mailto:bastinjafari@gmail.com).

For more information, please go to [About](https://www.resonance.wiki/section/about) (or top right corner of this page).
