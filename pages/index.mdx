# Welcome to the Resonance Wiki

## Please note that the site is in the early stages of its construction

This is a wiki for the Resonance Section of the [MIND Foundation](https://www.mind-foundation.org/) in Berlin. 

Resonance is the fundamental relational mode that enables us to connect with one another and the world we live in.

For a vibrant culture of consciousness, we need to resonate. You are invited to contribute to the content of the wiki, just as you are invited to contribute to the work of the Resonance Section overall. 

For any questions, please contact the section speakers and wiki hosts [Till Kastendieck](mailto:till.kastendieck@hu-berlin.de) and [Bastin Jafari](mailto:bastin.jafari@gmail.com).
